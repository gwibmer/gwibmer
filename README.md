My name is Gerardo Wibmer, I am a student at the University of South Florida majoring in Computer Scinece!

I am passionate about software development and eager to begin my career in the field. My skills include programming in C, C++, Java, and Python, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills and knowledge. As a senior student, I am well-equipped with the fundamental concepts and techniques required to build high-quality software, and I am ready to take on entry-level roles and start making meaningful contributions to the development community.

I aspire to build a comprehensive portfolio of my programming projects to showcase my skills. By compiling a collection of my software development work, I aim to demonstrate my abilities and capabilities as a programmer.
